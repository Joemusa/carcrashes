# Dataset Overview and Data Processing
The data set includes information about car accidents, including the date, severity, kind of vehicle, weather, type of road, and condition of the road's surface. Data was aggregated using DAX to produce measures like the annual accident rate.

# Insights and Findings
According to the dashboard, there were 144.9k fewer accidents, or a decline of -11.7%. On single-carrier roads, the highest accident rate occurs on days with fine weather and no wind. implying that when the weather is ideal for driving, drivers become careless.

# Recommendations
* Improve possible visibility on single-carrier routes
* Locate hotspots and place speed cameras there.
* Raise the fine to discourage careless driving
* Conduct campaigns on the roads
